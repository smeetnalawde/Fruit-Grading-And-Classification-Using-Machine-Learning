Fruit Grading and Classification
This project focuses on the automated grading and classification of fruits using advanced machine learning and image processing techniques. It aims to streamline quality control processes in the agricultural and food industries by accurately assessing fruit quality based on predefined standards.

Key Features:
Image Preprocessing: Implements techniques like resizing, normalization, and noise removal to prepare raw fruit images for analysis.
Feature Extraction: Extracts key features such as color, shape, texture, and size to aid in fruit classification.
Classification Models: Utilizes machine learning algorithms (e.g., SVM, Random Forest, or CNNs) for accurate identification and grading of fruits.
Grading Mechanism: Categorizes fruits based on visual quality, defects, and size to classify them into grades (e.g., A, B, C).
Interactive Visualizations: Provides insights into the classification process with clear visual outputs and metrics.
Scalability: Designed to handle large datasets of fruit images for industrial-scale deployment.

Objectives:
Automate Quality Control: Reduce manual effort and subjectivity in fruit grading.
Enhance Accuracy: Improve classification precision with advanced algorithms.
Support Industry Standards: Ensure compliance with grading standards used in agriculture and food supply chains.
